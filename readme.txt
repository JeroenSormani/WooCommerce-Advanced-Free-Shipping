WooCommerce Advanced Free Shipping is an plugin which allows you to set up advanced free shipping conditions.

== Description ==
With the WooCommerce Advanced Free Shipping plugin you can setup your own advanced rules to determine when a free shipping rate should be available for the customer.
This plugin will give you full control over your free WooCommerce shipping rates.

Within each shipping rate you can create multiple 'OR' condition groups with multiple 'AND' conditions inside each group. This means that it is very easy to setup a
 free shipping rate for multiple user roles in one shipping rate for example.

There are many default shipping conditions available.
*Conditions like:*

- Subtotal
- Quantity
- User role
- Country
- Zipcode
- Shipping class
- Category
- Weight
- Volume (Width / Length / Height)
- many, many more...

Not there what you're looking for? The plugin has been made to be easily extensible, meaning you can also add your own custom conditions through code snippets!

**Showing a free shipping threshold message**

There are a few plugins out there that add a message when someone hasn't reached the free shipping threshold yet. These plugin work on the 'Free shipping' option that is provided in WooCommerce by default.
It is unlikely that these plugins will work out of the box with Advanced Free Shipping due to the complexity of the conditional logic.

In case you do want to show this kind of message, The [Advanced Messages for WooCommerce](https://aceplugins.com/plugin/woocommerce-advanced-messages/) plugin allows you to setup a message with the same type of conditions, allowing you to setup the messages according to the same needs as the free shipping options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `woocommerce-advanced-free-shipping` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the settings page to fine-tune the settings if desired

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I setup partial free shipping? =

The short answer to this is 'no', the long answer comes down to 'possibly'. I wrote a full length blog post about this here:
[Apply free shipping for specific products in WooCommerce](http://jeroensormani.com/apply-free-shipping-for-specific-products-in-woocommerce/)

= Can multiple free shipping options show simultaneously? =

The current version of the plugin - 1.1.0 - doesn't have the ability to show multiple Advanced Free Shipping rates at the same time.
During first development I made the - in hindsight - wrong decision thinking "Why would anyone need multiple WooCommerce free shipping options at the same time".
In the future this will likely be changed, for now I recommend taking a look at the [Advanced Shipping for WooCommerce](http://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-advanced-shipping/8634573) plugin which does have the ability to show all rates that match the conditions.

= The shipping rates I configured are not showing at the cart/check, why? =

There are two common reasons why a rate may not be appearing when expected.

1) Shipping cache. It could be you're looking at cached shipping rates. I'd recommend enabling the [shipping debug mode](https://jeroensormani.com/shipping-debug-mode/) when testing.

2) A conflict in the conditions prevents the rate from appearing. For example, having two 'Country' conditions in one *condition group* is not possible.
Try and set a single condition such as 'Subtotal - greater - 0' and see if that will appear.

If after the above still no rate is showing it is most commonly a third party element that is interfering. Try disabling all other plugins / switch to a default theme and see if the rate is appearing then.
